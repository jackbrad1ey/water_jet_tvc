Storage and collaboration repository for MEC2402 water jet TVC development.
The purpose of this project was to design and construct a vehicle capable of testing TVC control algorithms. Water is used as its method of propulsion to greatly reduce costs and time during development and ensure safety, allowing for rapid iteration and testing of new control algorithms.
