Storage and collaboration repository for MEC2402 water jet TVC development.
The purpose of this project was to design and construct a vehicle capable of testing TVC control algorithms. Water is used as its method of propulsion to greatly reduce costs and time during development and ensure safety, allowing for rapid iteration and testing of new control algorithms.

The project features:
- Neptune, a custom flight computer designed to handle communication with ground station, control our servo motors, read from sensors and more.
- Neptune's firmware, consisting of a real time operating system that reads from our sensors and executes instructions based on packets sente from ground station.
- Ground station software, which is used to interact with the vehicle via a Jumper T-lite controller.
- CAD files for the vehicle and the associated testing stand.
